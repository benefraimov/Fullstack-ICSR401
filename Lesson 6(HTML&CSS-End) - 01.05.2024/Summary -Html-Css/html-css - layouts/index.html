<!--3 ways to build layouts-->
<!--
    1. The old way by Floats Layouts
    2. The Modern way by FlexBox - 1d
    2. Another Modern way by CSS Grid - 2d
    -->

<!--
    ------------------- Using Floats ----------------------
    -->

<!-- Float - Allowing positioning elements side by side -->
<!-- Float - If both children of an elements are floating
        the element will loose is height -->
<!--Clearing floats - add a child to clear the float on element(not a good approach)-->
<!--Clearing floats - clear: both;(if right & left)-->
<!--Clear Fix(good approach) - clearfix::after {display: block; content: ""; clear: both;(if right & left)}-->
<!--if an element is influenced by the element before and he his floating we can use clear:both-->

<!--
    ------------------- Using Flexbox ----------------------

    - Flexbox is a set of related CSS properties for building 1-dimensional layouts

    - The main idea behind flexbox is that enoty soace inside a container element can be automatically divided by its child elements

    - Flexbox makes it easy to automatically align items to one another inside a parent container, both horizontally and vertically

    - Flexbox solves common problems such as vertical centering and creating equal-height columns

    - FlexBox is perfect for replacing floats, allowing us to write fewer and cleaner HTML and CSS code
    -->


<!--
    ------------------- Using CSS Grid ----------------------

    - CSS Grid is a set of CSS properties for buildinf 2-dimensional layouts 

    - The main idea behind CSS Grid is that we devide a container element into rows and columns that can be filled with its child elements

    - In two-dimensional context, CSS Grid allows us to write less nested HTML and easier-to-read CSS  
    
    - CSS Grid is not meant  to replace flexbox! Instead, they work perfectly together. Need a 1D layout? Use flexbox. Need a 2D layout? Use CSS Grid
